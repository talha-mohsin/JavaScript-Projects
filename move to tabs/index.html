          Together, History, Vision, and Goal show my journey from learning the
          basics to building a clear direction for my future. My past shaped my
          skills, my vision guides my purpose, and my goals keep me focused on
          continuous growth as a developer. This reflects my commitment to
          learning, improvement, and creating meaningful impact through
          technology.
